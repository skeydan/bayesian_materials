2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
In point 3, focus on the diï¿½erence between the distribution of a large collection of random exponentials and the distribution of a large collection of averages of 40 exponentials.


    Did you show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution?
    Did you perform an exploratory data analysis of at least a single plot or table highlighting basic features of the data?
    Did the student perform some relevant confidence intervals and/or tests?
    Were the results of the tests and/or intervals interpreted in the context of the problem correctly?
    Did the student describe the assumptions needed for their conclusions? 

# Part 1: Central Limit Theorem

## Overview
In a few (2-3) sentences explain what is going to be reported on.

## Simulations

To demonstrate the CLT, we will sample 40 values from an exponential(0.2) distribution and do this a 1000 times.
```{r}
lambda <- 0.2
nsim <- 1000
n <- 40
```

We store the raw values ...

```{r}
m <- matrix(rexp(nsim * n, lambda), nsim, n)
dim(m)
```

... the means of each 40-element sample ...

```{r}
means <- apply(m, 1, mean)
head(means)
```

... as well as the mean of the sample means:

```{r}
sample_mean_of_means <- mean(means)
sample_mean_of_means
```


## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean

We can compare the means - and the mean of means - with the theoretical mean of the exponential(0.2) distribution, which is:

```{r}
dist_mean <- 1/lambda
dist_mean
```


Here we see a histogram of the 1000 means we obtained.
Also displayed is the theoretical mean (red line) and the mean of means (black line).

```{r}
ggplot(data_frame(m = means), aes(means)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15, color = 'cyan', fill = 'white') + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = dist_mean, color = 'red', size = 1) +  
  geom_vline(xintercept = sample_mean_of_means, color = 'black', size = 1) +
  ggtitle('Distribution of sample means from an exponential distribution, n=40')
```

As you see the theoretical mean and the mean of means are _very_ close:
Let's check the numbers:

```{r}
paste0('Mean of exponential distribution is: ', dist_mean, '. Mean of sample means is: ', sample_mean_of_means)
```


## Sample variance versus theoretical variance

Let's also have a look at the distribution of the sample variances:

```{r}
variances <- apply(m, 1, var)
head(variances)
```

Let's plot them

```{r}
ggplot(data_frame(m = variances), aes(variances)) + geom_histogram(bins = 15, color = 'cyan', fill = 'white') + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = dist_mean, color = 'red', size = 1) +  
  geom_vline(xintercept = sample_mean_of_means, color = 'black', size = 1) +
  ggtitle('Distribution of sample means from an exponential distribution, n=40')
```


We can also compare the theoretical variance of the exponential distribution to the variance of the sample means calculated above:

```{r}
dist_variance <- 1/lambda
variance_of_sample_means <- variance(means)
paste0('Variance of exponential distribution is: ', dist_variance, '. Variance of sample means is: ', variance_of_sample_means)
```


Include figures (output from R) with titles. Highlight the variances you are comparing. Include text that explains your understanding of the differences of the variances.

## Distribution

Via figures and text, explain how one can tell the distribution is approximately normal.    



# Part 2: Tooth growth data

```{r}
data("ToothGrowth")
head(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
```
